## My process

### Built with

- [Vite.js](https://vitejs.dev/)
- [tailwind](https://tailwindcss.com/) - for styles
- [daisyUI](https://daisyui.com/) - for styles

### Continued development

- Still getting a hang of Tailwind and Daisy UI for styling

### Useful resources

- [Google](https://www.google.com) - Yes, I google. My first move to a problem that I don't have any idea about. You should try it.

- [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/) - This helps me always.I have come to realize that for any problem I encounter, I am not the first, stack overflow always has my back.

- [ReactJs](https://react.dev) - This helps me to work with different components seamlessly just as mentioned in their docs.Javascript all through.

- [Tailwind](https://tailwindcss.com) - This is the best way of styling in my opinion.

- [DaisyUi](https://daisyui.com) - This is the most popular component library for Tailwind CSS. It helps get more logical class names to Tailwind css.
